Hivemall: Hive scalable machine learning library
=================================================

Hivemall is a scalable machine learning library that runs on Apache Hive, licensed under the LGPL 2.1.  
Hivemall is designed to be scalable to the number of training instances as well as the number of training features.

## Dear Hivemall stargazers/users, please [vote for Hivemall](https://hadoopsummit.uservoice.com/forums/242804-data-science-hadoop-track/suggestions/5568301-hivemall-scalable-machine-learning-library-for-ap) toward the Hadoop summit 2014! :-)

Supported Algorithms
--------------------

Hivemall provides machine learning functionality as well as feature engineering functions 
through UDFs/UDAFs/UDTFs of Hive.

## Classfication

* Perceptron

* Passive Aggressive (PA, PA1, PA2)

* Confidence Weighted (CW)

* Adaptive Regularization of Weight Vectors (AROW)

* Soft Confidence Weighted (SCW1, SCW2)

## Regression

* Logistic Regression using Stochastic Gradient Descent
  (parameter mixing and iterative parameter mixing)
  
* Passive Aggressive Regression (PA1, PA2)

* AROW regression

## Ensemble

* Bagging

## Loss functions

* SquaredLoss, LogisticLoss, HingeLoss, SquaredHingeLoss, QuantileLoss, EpsilonInsensitiveLoss

## Feature engineering
  
* Feature hashing (MurmurHash, SHA1)

* Feature scaling (Min-Max Normalization, Z-Score)

* Feature instances amplifier that reduces iterations on training

* Bias clause

* Data generator for one-vs-the-rest classifiers

System requirements
--------------------

* Hive 0.9 and later (Tested for v0.9 - v0.12)

* Hadoop 0.20.x (CDH3 is our target)

Basic Usage
------------

```sql
SELECT 
  feature, 
  CAST(avg(weight) as FLOAT) as weight
FROM
 (SELECT logress(features,label) as (feature,weight) FROM training_features) t
GROUP BY feature;
```

According to LGPL 2.1, softwares that modifies/copies Hivemall MUST open their source codes upon requests.  
On the other hand, softwares that uses the Hivemall jar package without any modification are no need to show their sources.
See GNU's [LGPL and Java page](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-java.en.html) for detail.

The LGPL does not require you to distribute source code of programs as far as just using/linking Hivemall in your application, so you can use Hivemall in closed-source apps and for most commercial uses.
